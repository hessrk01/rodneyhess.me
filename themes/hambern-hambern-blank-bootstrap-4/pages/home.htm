            So...I am a proud father of two. Husband. And I don't know what the hell I am doing right now. I mean I kind of do...

            Since both of my kids are older than 11, I am nothing more than an errand boy and taxi driver, someone who opens things, and an ATM. I have recently begun turning social anxiety and complacency into adventure and commitment. The adventure part is really about finding the next journey...the commitment was just needing to start something and accept failure, because failing is okay and starting is the hardest part.

            On a regular basis, I do technology stuff. I am a developer, both web and large enterprise systems, a systems engineer, a software development manager, a data manager, and a solutions architect (CTO). I enjoy being an individual contributor, but also being a part of a team, either way, I just want to do cool shit and have fun.
